# Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment
##### Author: Tiffany Gregory

#### Submission Information
* The submitted data set is tidy.  
* The Github repo contains the required scripts.  
* GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.  
* The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.  
* The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.  
  
#### Code information
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
